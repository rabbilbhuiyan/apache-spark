- This learning project aims to develop machine learning model using Spark. The project covers the following sections:
    - Spark DataFrame
    - Data pre-process (both numeric and text) using Spark's MLlib 
    - Model training with multiple algorithms e.g
      - Clustering
      - Classification
      - Regression
    - Model evaluation
    - Machine learning pipelines
